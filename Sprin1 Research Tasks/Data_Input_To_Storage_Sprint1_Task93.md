## Sprint1, Task 93: Input Data into Chosen Storage Solution and Organize for Retrieval

#### Task Overview
The team was tasked with inputting the necessary data into a chosen storage solution and organizing it for efficient retrieval.

#### Team Conclusion
Based on the results of previous research into data storage solutions, the team determined that implementing a storage solution is not necessary at this time. The current focus is on rendering a single 3D model using **Three.js**, which does not require complex data storage or retrieval. With no immediate need for a centralized data storage system, this task is deferred until more complex data interactions or additional models are introduced. It will be revisited when appropriate, once the project scope requires data storage and retrieval functionality.
