## Sprint 1, Task 110: Loading Animation Research Findings

During the research into loading animation options, it was found that **Three.js** offers built-in support for animations when using the **GLTF** format. GLTF, commonly used for exporting 3D models from **Blender**, efficiently handles both model data and animations, making it ideal for seamless integration into web applications.

Since **GLTF** inherently supports loading animations, additional external options are not required, simplifying the process. This conclusion indirectly fulfills tasks 64, 112, and others related to animation research. Given the tools employed (Blender, Three.js, GLTF), the integration of loading animations is well-supported and does not require further exploration.

### Key Points:
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering library for web applications, supporting GLTF for model and animation loading.
- **Blender**: 3D modeling tool, exports GLTF format with animations.
- **GLTF**: Format that includes animations, simplifying loading processes in Three.js.
- No need for external loading animation options due to native support in Three.js and GLTF.

This concludes the sprint task of researching loading animation integration.
