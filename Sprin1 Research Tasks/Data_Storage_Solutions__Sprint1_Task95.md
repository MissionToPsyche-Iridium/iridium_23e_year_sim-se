# Sprint 1, Task 95: Data Storage Solutions Research

## Task Overview
The team was tasked with researching and comparing different data storage solutions (e.g., JSON files, MySQL, PostgreSQL) for scalability, performance, and ease of access. The aim was to identify a centralized data storage structure to support the 3D model, improving scalability and easing updates on the project.

## Team Conclusion
During Sprint 1, the team determined that completing this task was not feasible at the current stage of the project. The backend infrastructure is not sufficiently developed to support a scalable storage solution, and the scientific data available has too much variation to define an effective data structure. For these reasons, the decision was made to postpone further work on this task until the backend and data requirements are more clearly defined.

## Preliminary Analysis of Storage Solutions
Despite the decision to postpone, some analysis of potential storage solutions was conducted to provide guidance for future consideration. Below are the key points:

### JSON Files:
- **Scalability**: Limited. JSON is more suitable for small to moderate amounts of data and less ideal for large, complex datasets.
- **Performance**: Simple to use for local storage or small datasets but lacks indexing and querying capabilities for larger datasets.
- **Ease of Access**: Very portable and easy to integrate with web applications like the 3D model, but less efficient when querying or managing complex data structures.
- **Conclusion**: Ideal for smaller projects or initial stages where the data structure is still evolving, but not scalable long-term.

### MySQL:
- **Scalability**: Strong. MySQL is a robust, mature relational database that can handle large datasets, provided the data is structured in a well-defined schema.
- **Performance**: Performs well for read-heavy operations and supports complex queries, but requires careful optimization as datasets grow.
- **Ease of Access**: SQL is widely used, and there is broad support for MySQL, making it easy to integrate with most backend systems.
- **Conclusion**: Suitable for structured data with a clear schema. It provides high performance and scalability but is less flexible when the data schema is likely to evolve.

### PostgreSQL:
- **Scalability**: Excellent. PostgreSQL is highly scalable and can handle complex datasets, including JSON data and more flexible data types.
- **Performance**: Performs well for both read and write operations, and offers advanced features such as full-text search, indexing, and support for large datasets.
- **Ease of Access**: Like MySQL, it has strong community support and is widely used. Its flexibility in handling both structured and unstructured data gives it an edge.
- **Conclusion**: Offers greater flexibility than MySQL, especially for handling evolving or complex data structures. More suitable for projects with varied or complex data requirements.

## Recommendation
The team recommends revisiting the task in a future sprint once the backend infrastructure is more developed and the data requirements are clearer. At that point, MySQL or PostgreSQL would likely offer better scalability and performance compared to JSON, with PostgreSQL offering more flexibility for handling scientific data with variable structures.
