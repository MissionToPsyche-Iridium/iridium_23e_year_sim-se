## Sprint1, Task 99: Research Lazy Loading for 3D Models

#### Task Overview
The team was tasked with researching lazy loading techniques to ensure that 3D models are only loaded when necessary, such as when the user navigates to a specific section of the webpage.

#### Team Conclusion
Upon reviewing the tools being used, specifically **Three.js** and the project's focus on a single, interactive 3D model, the team concluded that lazy loading is unnecessary. Since the entire webpage is dedicated to displaying the 3D model, loading it fully on page load provides the best user experience and simplifies the implementation process. The team now understands that lazy loading is not relevant in this context, and the model can be preloaded without concern for performance.
