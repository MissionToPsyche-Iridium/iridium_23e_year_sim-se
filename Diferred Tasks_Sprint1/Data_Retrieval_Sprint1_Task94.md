# Sprint 1, Task 94: Data Retrieval Script Development


## Team Conclusion
This task has been deemed unnecessary at this stage of the project. During the research into data storage solutions and the current state of the backend infrastructure, it was concluded that the projectâ€™s backend is not yet sufficiently developed to implement a central data storage solution. Additionally, the variability in the scientific data prevents the definition of a stable data structure at this time.

Since no central data storage has been established, there is no need for a data retrieval function at this stage. The task will be revisited when the backend infrastructure and data structure are more clearly defined and implemented.

## Recommendation
This task is postponed until the backend and data storage are fully developed. At that point, the retrieval script can be implemented as needed, based on the chosen storage solution and defined data structure.
