## Sprint1, Task 98: Provide Documentation on Loading and Unloading Dynamic Content

#### Task Overview
The team was tasked with providing documentation on how dynamic content is loaded, unloaded, and how future content can be added to the system.

#### Team Conclusion
Based on the progress made in understanding content loading in **Three.js**, the team concluded that detailed documentation on dynamic content loading and unloading is premature. For the current project, the 3D model can be loaded fully on page load, eliminating the need for dynamic content management. Future content or features can be added once the system evolves to include more complex interactions or additional models. The team will revisit documentation once the projectâ€™s scope expands.
