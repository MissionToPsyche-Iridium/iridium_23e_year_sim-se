## Sprint 1, Task 92: Research and Consolidate Factual Information for the Project

#### Task Overview
This task involved researching and consolidating factual information necessary for the projectâ€™s development.

#### Team Conclusion
While factual information remains important for future iterations, the team determined that it is not immediately needed for the current stage of the project. The data available has too much variation to begin meaningful consolidation without a more developed front-end product to provide context. As the project currently focuses on the display of a single interactive model, the team has postponed further work on consolidating factual data until it is directly needed. Once the project evolves to include additional features or models, and the data requirements become clearer, this task will be revisited.
