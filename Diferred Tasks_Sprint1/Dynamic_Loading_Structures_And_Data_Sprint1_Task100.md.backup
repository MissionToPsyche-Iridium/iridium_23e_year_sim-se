## Sprint 1, Task 100: Research Dynamic Loading for Textures and Factual Data

#### Task Overview
The team was tasked with researching dynamic loading techniques for textures and factual data to ensure they are fetched and applied only when necessary.

#### Team Conclusion
Dynamic loading of textures and factual data remains a relevant consideration for future expansion, but at this point in the project, it is not required. Given that the focus is on a single 3D model that is fully loaded on page load, there is no immediate need for dynamic texture or data fetching. Additionally, since the backend storage structure has been deferred, there is no need to implement a dynamic data loading system at this stage. The team has gained clarity on the immediate needs of the project and will explore dynamic loading when more complex data interactions or models are introduced in future phases.
