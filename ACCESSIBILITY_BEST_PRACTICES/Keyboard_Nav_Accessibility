### Key Principles of Accessible Keyboard Navigation in 3D Models

#### Simplicity and Intuition

- **Use familiar keyboard inputs**: The keyboard layout should align with standard web navigation keys. The **arrow keys** for movement (up, down, left, right), and the **Tab key** for cycling through interactive elements.
- **Avoid complex key combinations**: Use simple keypresses rather than requiring the user to remember multiple or complex combinations.

#### Consistent Focus Management

- **Ensure visual focus indicators**: Users should always know where they are in the navigation. Use clear visual cues (such as highlighting) to indicate the selected object or active camera angle.
- **Tab through focusable elements**: When navigating, ensure the **Tab key** cycles through all interactive and navigable elements in the scene. Each 3D object that can be interacted with should receive focus.

#### Descriptive Labels and Announcements

- **Screen reader compatibility**: Any interactable element or object within the 3D model should have descriptive labels announced by screen readers. This can be implemented using **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** roles and properties.
- **Spatial audio or text announcements**: For visually impaired users, consider adding spoken feedback when navigating in the model. For instance, when a new section is reached, a brief description can be provided.

#### Focus on Camera Navigation

- **Camera controls using the keyboard**:
  - **Arrow keys** for rotating the camera around the model.
  - **Page Up/Down** or **W/S keys** for zooming in and out.
  - **Q/E keys** or **Shift + Arrow Keys** for moving the camera laterally (left/right or up/down).
- **Reset view**: Provide a simple key (such as the **R key**) to reset the camera view to a default state. This helps users if they get disoriented during navigation.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts for Common Actions

- **Common navigation actions** should be assigned to easy-to-remember keys. For instance:
  - **Arrow keys** or **WASD** for moving through the environment.
  - **Spacebar** to activate or select objects.
  - **Enter key** to confirm actions.
- Provide users with a brief guide or help modal (accessed by a key like **H**) that explains the available keyboard shortcuts.

#### Limit Over-Scrolling

- Ensure that camera movement is controlled and doesnâ€™t allow the user to scroll infinitely in one direction. Set boundaries or limits to how far the camera or objects can be moved.

#### Customizable Controls

- Where possible, allow users to **customize keyboard controls**. This is especially helpful for users who may need non-standard setups due to physical disabilities or other specific needs.

#### Implement Focus Traps in 3D Space

- When a user is interacting with a specific object or section of the 3D environment, **trap the focus** within that area to avoid confusion or accidental navigation away from the area of interest. The user should need to explicitly leave that area (e.g., using the **Esc key**).

### Technical Considerations for Implementing Keyboard Accessibility in Three.js

#### Event Listeners for Key Input

Use JavaScript to add **event listeners** for keyboard input. Specifically, for Three.js, integrate these controls with the camera or objects within the scene.

```
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    switch(event.code) {
        case 'ArrowUp':
            // Move camera or object forward
            break;
        case 'ArrowDown':
            // Move camera or object backward
            break;
        // Add more cases for other keys
    }
});
```
#### Screen Reader Accessibility

Although Three.js primarily handles rendering, you need to work alongside HTML elements for accessibility:

- **Add ARIA roles** to important focus points in your model.
- **Ensure every interaction** has a corresponding **textual label** that can be read aloud by screen readers.
- **Use offscreen content** to describe parts of the model that are hard to visually perceive.

#### Focus Management with Three.js

Manage focus using **HTML overlay** or by handling focus states within the 3D canvas itself.

```js
let focusableElements = ['Object1', 'Object2'];
let currentFocusIndex = 0;

document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.code === 'Tab') {
        event.preventDefault();
        currentFocusIndex = (currentFocusIndex + 1) % focusableElements.length;
        // Set focus to the next element in focusableElements
    }
});
```
#### Using Accessible 3D Libraries

Look into libraries that extend accessibility support for Three.js. These libraries help you manage ARIA labels, focus states, and keyboard input more effectively:

- **THREE.Interactive**: A plugin that provides some built-in interaction management for 3D objects in Three.js.
- **A-Frame**: A framework on top of Three.js that has more built-in accessibility features.
