Psyche Issues for consideration:
modify structure to be Single Page Application using Vue, Svelt, React, or other. 
Add favicon for browser tab
Main page settings icon (turn on and off animation, dark mode) position is fixed, does not dynamically 
adjust or reposition. Perhaps relocate to ultimate top left corner or higher up, just below Psyche logo?
Settings popup too large for its contents. Shrink this and update for better aesthetics. Ensure settings 
window doesn’t block page animations. 
cookies or local storage to remember page settings across site. If animations are turned off on one page,
keep them off for all pages?
Find a better icon/link for physics page and/or other pages
Switching to dark mode, then back to light mode doesn’t reset the h1 font color. 
Alternative dark mode colors. Not just all black. 
Perhaps even a star field background?

Integrate Mission Event Data into Timeline:
Populate the timeline component with mission event data—including dates, descriptions, and interactive markers—to provide users with a detailed history of mission events.

Implement Smooth Animations and Transitions for Timeline Interactions:
Enhance the timeline by applying smooth scrolling and visual transitions that create a more engaging and fluid user experience when interacting with timeline markers.

Design the Dashboard Layout for Simulation Metrics:
Create a clear and professional dashboard layout that visually organizes key metrics (such as time allocation, resource usage, and mission milestones) using charts and graphs.

Develop Interactive Charts with Real-Time Updates:
Use a JavaScript charting library to implement interactive charts that automatically update in real time based on incoming simulation data, allowing users to explore detailed insights.

Implement Dark/Light Mode Toggle for Theme Customization:
Add a toggle switch to the UI that enables users to seamlessly switch between dark and light themes, ensuring the site is comfortable to view in different environments.
