                <h4>Age in Years</h4>
                <p>If you were born on Psyche, you will be much younger than those born around the same time on Earth.</p>
                <p>Calculator to enter your birth year and get ages in Psyche years and earth years </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-three">
                <h4>Day Length </h4>
                <p>The day is only 4.5 horus so you will need to get everything done that you need to do in about 3 hours to save one hour to sleep. </p>
                <p>If some professions work 12 hour shifts, that would be working three straight days on Psyche without going to sleep. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-three">
                <h4>One meal a day </h4>
                <p>You might only have time to eat one meal a day on Psyche.</p>
                <p>If you eat lunch at 12pm noon and then dinner at 5pm, you might have skipped an entire day on Psyche without eating! </p>
                <p>You might need to eat meals much quicker to save as much time in the day as you can. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-three">
                <h4>School Days</h4>
                <p>School days on Psyche would be around 1 hour if they were relative to those school days on earth. </p>
                <p>But, the school year would be 5 earth years long! If you started kindergarden on Psyche as the same time as students on Earth, when you finished 1st grade, the earth students would have finished 5th grade.</p>
