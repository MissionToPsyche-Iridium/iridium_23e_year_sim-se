                        <h4>Temperatures on Psyche</h4>
                        <p>You will need to dress warm, as Psyche's temperature ranges from X to X</p>
                        <p>Be careful exploring as the dark side of Psyche is the coldest with temperatures believed to get as low as -X</p>

                        <h4>Psyche's surface</h4>
                        <p>Your team is going to need to prepare for long days as the asteroid's surface area is approximately 165,800 square kilometers.</p>
                        <p>This potato-like asteroid is 173 miles wide, and 144 miles long</p>
                        <p>Psyche is about the same size as the state of Maryland</p>

                    <div class="grid-three">
                        <h4>Reason for the mission</h4>
                        <p>Scientists think Psyche may consist of significant amounts of metal from the core of a planetesimal, one of the building blocks
                            of our solar system.
                        </p>
                        <p>The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming</p>
                        <p>Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth's core and the cores of the other rocky, or terrestrial, planets came to be.</p>

                    <div class="grid-three">
                        <h4>Psyche's location</h4>
                        <p>Psyche orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter at a distance ranging from 235 million to 309 million miles (378 million to 497 million kilometers) from the Sun</p>
                        <p>Thatâ€™s 2.5 to 3.3 Astronomical Units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="grid-three">
                        <h4>Psyche's name</h4>
                        <p>Psyche was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on March 17, 1852.</p>
                        <p>Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul who was born mortal and married Eros (Roman Cupid), the god of Love.</p>
                        <p>Because it was the 16th asteroid to be discovered, it is sometimes referred to as 16 Psyche. </p>
