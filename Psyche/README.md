List of tasks with descriptions:

---

### **Task 1: Set up the Three.js canvas and dual renderers**  
**Description:** Create a foundational Three.js canvas that supports two separate renderers for the two scenes. Ensure the renderers can coexist without performance issues and occupy distinct areas of the viewport.

---

### **Task 2: Initialize Scene 1 (16 Psyche view)**  
**Description:** Set up the first scene to display a 3D model of a single celestial object. Add initial lighting, a camera, and a placeholder model to establish the framework for future enhancements.

---

### **Task 3: Initialize Scene 2 (solar system view)**  
**Description:** Set up the second scene to display the broader solar system. Create a placeholder sun and planetary objects, positioning them to represent an orbital configuration. Include a highlighted placeholder for the featured celestial object.

---

### **Task 4: Implement interactivity for swapping and resizing scenes**  
**Description:** Add functionality to toggle the prominence of the two scenes. Ensure that one expands to fill the viewport while the other shrinks and moves to a corner. Implement smooth transitions and maintain proper scaling during resizing.

---

### **Task 5: Add orbit controls to Scene 2**  
**Description:** Enable user interaction in the solar system scene, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera to explore different perspectives. Ensure the controls do not interfere with the rendering of Scene 1.

---

### **Task 6: Model or import detailed 3D assets for the celestial object**  
**Description:** Replace the placeholder model in Scene 1 with a detailed 3D asset of the celestial object. Apply realistic textures and materials to enhance visual fidelity.

---

### **Task 7: Add informational overlays for both scenes**  
**Description:** Design and implement toggleable overlays that display educational content. Ensure overlays are styled to align with the applicationâ€™s theme and remain responsive to screen size and scene transitions.

---

### **Task 8: Optimize rendering performance for dual scenes**  
**Description:** Implement optimizations to ensure smooth performance, such as limiting unnecessary rendering, reducing polygon counts where possible, and optimizing lighting and materials for efficiency.

---

### **Task 9: Conduct usability testing and refine user interactions**  
**Description:** Perform user testing to identify any usability or performance issues. Gather feedback on the controls, scene transitions, and overlays. Make iterative refinements to improve the overall user experience.
