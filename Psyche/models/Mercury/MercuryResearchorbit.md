# Mercury's Orbit Simulation Guide

  

This guide details how to implement a realistic simulation of Mercury's elliptical orbit around the Sun using Three.js. The following key orbital characteristics, parameters, and methods are outlined for accurate modeling.

## Orbital Shape

  

-  **Elliptical Orbit**: Mercury's orbit is elliptical, with the Sun located at one of its foci.

-  **Eccentricity**: 0.2056 (more elongated compared to Earth).

-  **Implementation**: Use an elliptical path (not a perfect circle) for Mercury's motion.

## Orbital Parameters

- **Semi-Major Axis (a)**: Average distance from Mercury to the Sun is 0.387 AU (~57.91 million km).

- **Semi-Minor Axis (b)**:
  - Formula:  
    b = a * sqrt{1 - e^2}
    where \( e \) is the eccentricity (~0.2056).
  - For simplicity in visualization, you can approximate \( b \approx a \) but include eccentricity adjustments for realism.

- **Orbital Speed & Period**:
  - **Orbital Period**: 87.97 Earth days (Mercury’s year).
  - **Average Speed**: ~47.87 km/s.
  - **Speed Variation**: Faster near perihelion (closest to the Sun), slower near aphelion.

## Orbital Inclination

  

-  **Inclination to the Ecliptic**: 7.005°.

- Apply a tilt to the orbital plane for realism in your 3D scene.

## Orbital Orientation

  

-  **Perihelion**: Closest point to the Sun, around 46 million km.

-  **Aphelion**: Farthest point from the Sun, around 70 million km.

-  **Longitude of Perihelion**: ~77°.

## Implementation Steps in Three.js

### 1. Understanding Elliptical Orbits
- An ellipse is defined by:
  - **Semi-Major Axis (a)**: Longest radius.
  - **Semi-Minor Axis (b)**: Shortest radius.
  - **Eccentricity (e)**: Degree of elongation.

### Parametric Equations (2D)

x = a * cos(t)
y = b * sin(t)

In 3D space, apply a tilt using rotation transformations.


  

### 2. Creating an Elliptical Path in Three.js

  

#### A. Generate the Orbit Path

  

- Use parametric equations to calculate points along the ellipse:

- Define a range of angles \( t \) (e.g., 0 to \( 2\pi \)).

- Compute \( x \) and \( y \) using the semi-major and semi-minor axes.

- Create a `THREE.Curve` or use precomputed points to define the path:

- Use `THREE.Curve` for dynamic paths or precompute points and use `THREE.BufferGeometry`.

  

#### B. Visualize the Path with `THREE.Line`

  

- Convert the computed points into a `THREE.BufferGeometry` and create a `THREE.Line` to display the orbit path.

  

#### C. Position the Sun at One Focus

  

- For an ellipse with semi-major axis \( a \) and eccentricity \( e \), shift the ellipse by \( ae \) along its major axis to correctly position the Sun.

### 3. Positioning Mercury on the Ellipse

- **Calculate Mercury’s Position**:  
  Use Keplerian elements or parametric equations to determine Mercury’s position at any given time:

  x = a * cos(t)
  y = b * sin(t)


- **3D Consideration**:  
  If working in 3D space, start by setting \( z = 0 \). You can later apply rotations to the plane to account for the orbital inclination.

- **Update Mercury’s Position**:  
  Use the following method to update Mercury’s position:
  ```javascript
  Object3D.position.set(x, y, z);

  

---

  

### 4. Apply Orbital Tilt

  

-  **Orbital Inclination (~7.005°)**:

- Rotate the orbital plane to reflect Mercury's inclination.

- Apply a rotation transformation:

-  **Rotation Axis**: Perpendicular to the orbital plane (commonly the x- or z-axis).

-  **Rotation Method**: Use a matrix transformation or set rotation directly on the path object.

  

---

  

### 5. Adjust Orbital Speed

  

- Use **Kepler's Second Law**:

- Mercury moves faster near perihelion (closest to the Sun) and slower near aphelion.

- This maintains realistic motion, adhering to the conservation of angular momentum.

-  **Calculate the True Anomaly**  Over Time:

- The true anomaly represents the angle between the current position and the closest approach to the Sun.

- Use orbital equations or a time-based algorithm to dynamically update Mercury's position along its elliptical path.

By following these steps, you can accurately simulate Mercury's orbital dynamics around the Sun in a Three.js environment. Adjust parameters as needed for scale and animation speed to achieve the desired level of detail.
