    introLink: `<h2>Introduction of Name Origin for Psyche</h2>
        <p>Psyche is a metal-rich asteroid orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.</p>
        <p>The "16" in 16 Psyche indicates that this asteroid was the sixteenth to be discovered. It was found by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on March 17, 1852. Astronomers use a numerical designation in the order of discovery, such as 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and so on.</p>
        <p>The asteroid was named after Psyche (pronounced <em>psoo-KHEE</em>), a figure from Greek mythology. Psyche was a mortal woman known for her extraordinary beauty who was eventually deified as the goddess of the soul. She represents the human soul, especially as refined through suffering, endurance, and love.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, it was customary to name asteroids after mythological figures, particularly female ones. The name Psyche was likely chosen because of this tradition and also for its symbolic resonance. Given the asteroid’s location in the outer part of the main belt and, as later discovered, its high metal content, the name evokes depth and the idea of a planetary core—mirroring the soul as the innermost essence.</p>`,

    historyLink: `<h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>Psyche was discovered in 1852 by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis and is one of the largest asteroids in our solar system.</p>
        <p>Because it was the 16th asteroid to be discovered, it is sometimes referred to as 16 Psyche.</p>
        <p>Scientists have proposed several ideas about how Psyche formed. One early theory suggested that it is the leftover metallic core of a much larger body that lost its outer layers in a massive collision. A similar idea proposed multiple, gentler collisions instead. However, newer data doesn't fully support these core-remnant theories.</p>
        <p>Another possibility is that Psyche broke apart and then re-formed under gravity as a mix of metal and rock. If so, it might be the source of rare stony–iron meteorites called mesosiderites.</p>
        <p>A third idea suggests that Psyche experienced iron volcanism—a process where molten metal erupted onto the surface as it cooled. Radar studies have recently supported this idea, especially if metal is concentrated in specific regions that could be ancient volcanic centers.</p>`,

    missionLink: `<h2>NASA's Psyche Mission</h2>
        <p>The Psyche spacecraft, designed by NASA, aims to study the asteroid to understand more about planetary cores and the history of the solar system. The Psyche spacecraft is traveling to a unique metal-rich asteroid with the same name, orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. By August 2029 the spacecraft will begin exploring the asteroid that scientists theroize that, because of its high metal content, it may be the partial core of a planetesimal, a building block of an early planet.</p>`,

    funFactsLink: `<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>Psyche is primarily composed of nickel and iron, much like Earth's core.</p>
        <p>Psyche is irregular and potato-like. If the asteroid were sliced in half horizontally at the equator—picture a squished oval—it would measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144 miles (232 kilometers) long.</p>
        <p>Its surface area is 64,000 square miles (165,000 square kilometers).</p>
        <p>Its name means 'soul' in Greek mythology.</p>`
