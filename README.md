Psyche Issues for consideration:
modify structure to be Single Page Application using Vue, Svelt, React, or other. 
Add favicon for browser tab
Main page settings icon (turn on and off animation, dark mode) position is fixed, does not dynamically 
adjust or reposition. Perhaps relocate to ultimate top left corner or higher up, just below Psyche logo?
Settings popup too large for its contents. Shrink this and update for better aesthetics. Ensure settings 
window doesn’t block page animations. 
cookies or local storage to remember page settings across site. If animations are turned off on one page,
keep them off for all pages?
Find a better icon/link for physics page and/or other pages
Switching to dark mode, then back to light mode doesn’t reset the h1 font color. 
Alternative dark mode colors. Not just all black. 
Perhaps even a star field background?
