## Some items that need attention:  
* implementing the background changer and adding backgrounds
* information and styling to the "references" section
* make page responsive, update for smaller devices

* navigation menu - Solar Arc? A subtle, curved (arc) appears along one edge of the screen (bottom), representing an orbital path. Each menu item (a planet, moon, or waypoint) is positioned along the arc. As users interact, elements dynamically adjust

* iframe triggers. Instead of immediately loading and rendering iframe elements, build out the section with basic data and models. Add a trigger animate the iframe into the scene. 

* performance checker to assist with background objects and resource usage
    const isLowPerformance = navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4; 
    if (isLowPerformance) {
        createStarfield(scene, { density: 0.5 });
        bloomPass.strength = 1.0;
    }


    Real-Device Testing will be conducted through the use of developer accessible devices, confirming real-world usability, proper interaction with touch gestures, scrolling behavior, and dynamic content adjustments. Testing will be conducted on developer owned devices to include:
Desktop Monitors: A 27", 32", and ultrawide 49" screen
Tablets: Samsung Tab S8 Ultra (large tablet) and iPad Pro 11"
Laptops: 14" and 16" models
Smartphones:
iPhone Models: a variant of the iPhone Mini, iPhone Pro, and iPhone Pro Max
Android Models: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and S23 SE
